# vue-media-library-image
A simple vue component to show Spatie.be's responsive images created by github.com/spatie/laravel-media-library

## Usage
Installation
```
npm install vue-media-library-image
```

In app.js
```
import ResponsiveImage from 'vue-media-library-image';
Vue.use(ResponsiveImage);
```

In your views
```
<responsive-image :image="{srcset:'',url:'',width:''}" fallback-image="/path/to/image.jpg">
</responsive-image>
```

That should do it! Let me know what you think of my first open source component.
